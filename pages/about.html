    <h2>About</h2>

    <div id="about-text" class="main-text">
        Floorplan 3D is a piece of software written for an MSc project that quickly converts images of 2D architectural building plans into 3D models. 
        These models can then be viewed in the app, or downloaded to be viewed in other modelling software, or in VR.<br>
        For best results it is recommended to use high quality images, with a good contrast between wall colour and background colour. Also ensure that the image is cropped 
        so that the building takes up as much of the frame as possible (you can do this using the cropping functionality within the app). It also works best if as many of the 
        plan's walls are parallel with the sides of the image as possible.
        Accepted image formats are .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp and .gif. The models that are generated are fairly basic, and are only intended to give an idea of what a 
        building might look like.

        I hope you enjoy using Floorplan 3D!
